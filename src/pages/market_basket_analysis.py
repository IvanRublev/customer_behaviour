        * __Support__: Frequency of the items X and Y bought together appearance 
                       in the data set, as number of transactions with the items 
                       to toal transactions
        * __Confidence__: Percentage of all transactions satisfying X that also satisfy Y, 
                          as number of transactions with X and Y to total transactions with X
        * __Lift__: Observed support divided by expected support if X and Y were independent. 
                    If >1 then X and Y are more likely to be dependent on each other
        * __Conviciton__: The ratio of the expected frequency that the rule makes incorrect
                          prediction if X and Y were independent to the observed frequency 
                          of incorrect predictions. Conviction of 1.2 means that the rule 
                          is incorrect 20% times more often if the association 
                          between X and Y were purely random
